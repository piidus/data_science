    ">An application programming interface (API) is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software. A document or standard that describes how to build or use such a connection or interface is called an API specification. A computer system that meets this standard is said to implement or expose an API. The term API may refer either to the specification or to the implementation.\n",

    ">>Cost :: Providing an API is expensive in terms of development time, ongoing maintenance, providing API documentation on your website and providing support to users of your API.\n",

    ">>Security exposure :: Adding an API adds another attack surface to your website.\n",
    "\n",
    ">>Any One might not like the result or anyone may change business direction. It's not always easy to predict exactly how the API will be used. If your integration with a messaging system means that users login to that service less often, will there be an overall negative impact for you? Withdrawing an API can be painful for users if you decide that you need to do so. This is unusual but it can happen."

Because it is a protocol, it imposes built-in rules that increase its complexity and overhead, which can lead to longer page load times. However, these standards also offer built-in compliances that can make it preferable for enterprise scenarios. The built-in compliance standards include security, atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID), which is a set of properties for ensuring reliable database transactions."
