    "\n",
    "Bayes' theorem is a statistical concept used to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence or data. It was named after the English statistician Thomas Bayes and is often used in probability theory and Bayesian statistics.\n",

    "The theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H, given some observed evidence E, can be calculated using the following formula:\n",

    "Suppose there is a certain disease that affects 1 in 1000 people. You go to the doctor and take a test for the disease, which has an accuracy of 95%, meaning that if you have the disease, the test will correctly identify it 95% of the time, and if you do not have the disease, the test will correctly identify it as negative 95% of the time.\n",

    "- P(~D) = 0.999 (the prior probability of not having the disease)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these values, we can calculate the probability of having the disease given a positive test result as follows:\n",
